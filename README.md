# Data Structures and Sorting Algorithms

This repository contains various data structures and sorting algorithm implementations. Each algorithm and data structure is placed in its respective directory with code examples and explanations. These algorithms can be used for educational purposes or in various applications that require sorting and data structure manipulation.

## Data Structures

1. **Array**:
   - A collection of elements identified by index or key. Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations.
   - Find the implementation in `ArrayDataStructure`.

2. **Linked List**:
   - A linear collection of elements, where each element points to the next. Ideal for dynamic memory allocation.
   - Find the implementation in `Link List Data structure`.

3. **Queue**:
   - A First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure. Elements are added at the end and removed from the front.
   - Find the implementation in `Queue Data Structure`.

4. **Stack**:
   - A Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure. Elements are added and removed from the top.
   - Find the implementation in `Stack Data Structure`.

5. **Tree**:
   - A hierarchical data structure with a root element and sub-elements (children). Ideal for hierarchical models such as file systems.
   - Find the implementation in `Tree Data Structure`.

## Sorting Algorithms

1. **Bubble Sort**:
   - A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
   - Find the implementation in `Bubble Sort`.

2. **Insertion Sort**:
   - Builds the final sorted array one element at a time. It assumes that one element is sorted and inserts the next element in the correct position.
   - Find the implementation in `Insertion Sort`.

3. **Merge Sort**:
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the two sorted halves.
   - Find the implementation in `Marge Sort`.

4. **Quick Sort**:
   - A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array around that pivot.
   - Find the implementation in `Quick Sort`.

5. **Selection Sort**:
   - Repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element.
   - Find the implementation in `Selection Sort`.
